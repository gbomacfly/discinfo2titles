# discinfo2titles

This script is used for converting a `disc.info` generated from `Wii Backup Manager` into a `titles.txt`, which can be read by `Configurable USB Loader`.

### Usage
* copy a `disc.info`-file into the same folder as the script
* remove the first two lines in it (WBM disc info)
* `chmod +x discinfo2titles.py`
* `python3 discinfo2titles.py`
